Here are a few examples of how you could use standard Jira fields to determine whether an issue is in the correct project:

Keywords in the summary or description: You could use regular expressions or natural language processing techniques to search for specific keywords in the summary or description of the issue. If the keywords match those associated with a particular project, then the issue is likely to be in the correct project.

Comparing issue type with project: Jira allows you to associate a specific issue type with a project. If an issue's type does not match the type specified for the project it is associated with, then it's likely that the issue is in the wrong project.

Comparing components with project: Similar to issue types, Jira also allows you to associate specific components with a project. If an issue's components do not match the components specified for the project it is associated with, then it's likely that the issue is in the wrong project.

Checking the assignee or reporter: An issue that has been assigned to or reported by a user who is not a member of the project team is likely to be in the wrong project.

Checking the custom fields: Jira allows you to define custom fields for issues, such as labels, versions, etc. you could use these fields to determine whether an issue is in the correct project.
